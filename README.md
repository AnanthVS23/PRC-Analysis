# PRC-Analysis
#These codes are a part of the work to simulate neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex and analyze their phase response curves for checking stability in a single and two cluster case. 
#For the single cluster case, we consider 25 self connected Parvalbumin positive (PV+) inhibitory interneurons (INs) with one neuron perturbed and check stability of synchrony for both hyperpolarizing and shunting reversal potential.
